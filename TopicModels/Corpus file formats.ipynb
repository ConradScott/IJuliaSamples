    "* Any function that reads text should accept a pre-existing vocabulary to specify the token to id mappings; if no vocabulary is provided it should create one from scratch.\n",
    "What should happen if a vocabulary is provided but it does not contain entries for all tokens in the input? Have extensible and non-extensible vocabulary types? Have a separate option to control this behaviour?\n",
    "If the vocabulary is not extended, the parser can either fail or succeeds but discards the unmapped tokens. Again, how is this controlled or decided?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Stop word processing also changes vocabularies, so we need to be able to filter on a corpus to reduce it to a narrower vocabulary. This could be used to defer a decision on how to handle a pre-provided vocabulary when reading: The resulting corpus contains a vocabulary that may be larger than that provided, but all words common to both are encoded with the same index. The resulting corpus can then be filtered back down to the original vocabulary if desired."
